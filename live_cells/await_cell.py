    The value of the returned cell is the completed value of the

    exception, then accessing the value of the returned cell raises

    If multiple arguments are given a cell is returned that awaits the
    coroutine held in ``self`` and each cell in ``cells``. The value
    of the cell is a list holding the completed value of ``self``
    followed by the completed value of each cell in ``cells``. This is
    equivalent to the following.

    .. code-block:: python

       [await self(), await cells[0](), ...]

    The difference between a single call to ``awaited``:

    .. code-block:: python

       @computed
       def sum():
           x, y = awaited(a, b)()
           return x, y

    and multiple calls to ``awaited``:

    .. code-block:: python

       @computed
       def sum():
           return a.awaited()() + b.awaited()()

    becomes apparent when an updated to the argument cells is
    triggered by a common ancestor of both ``a`` and ``b``. With a
    single call to ``awaited``, the value of the ``sum`` cell is
    recomputed only once when both the coroutines held in ``a`` and
    ``b`` have completed. In the second example, the value of ``sum``
    is recomputed once when the coroutine held in ``a`` has completed
    and a second time when the coroutine held in ``b`` has completed.
